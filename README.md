# StarWarsGame

Uh oh! Your favorite Star Wars characters have gotten their light sides and dark sides mixed up in the wash, causing them to all fight each other for no reason! Let that be a lesson to you on the importance of proper laundry technique.

To play, click on a player character, then an enemy character. Click the “Attack” button until the enemy is dead. Repeat until you've heartlessly slaughtered them all, you monster. When the game's over, you can click the “Play Again” button to play again, and again, and again, and again, providing literally _minutes_ of fun for the whole family!

Now mobile-friendly!

Star Wars, the characters, and all the audio clips are property of Lucasfilm, which is now owned by Disney, and are used without permission. However, I had no choice, as the terms of the assignment required it, so it's not my fault. Please don't sue me! I'm sure we can work out a solution, if we just calm down and talk about this like reasonable gentlemen... _(reaches for blaster)_
